# Data-Science-SpaceX-Falcon-9-First-Stage-Landing-Prediction
IBM Applied Data Science Capstone

## Project Description

In this capstone project, we will predict whether the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX, a leading space company, offers Falcon 9 rocket launches at a much lower cost than other providers, at around 62 million dollars. One of the main reasons for the lower cost is SpaceX's ability to reuse the first stage of the Falcon 9 rocket after launch.

The goal of the project is to utilize historical data on Falcon 9 first stage landings to build a predictive model that can accurately estimate whether a landing will be successful or not. The information generated from this model can be used by other companies looking to compete with SpaceX in rocket launch bidding.

In the early stages of the project, we will collect data about the Falcon 9 first stage landing. We will use various data sources, including RESTful APIs and web scraping techniques. Once the data is collected, we will clean and organize this data into a dataframe for data manipulation.

Next, we will build an interactive dashboard that allows us to analyze launch records in real time. This dashboard will be developed using Plotly Dash, a framework that allows for quick and easy creation of interactive web applications.

Finally, we will use machine learning techniques to build a predictive model. This model will be trained using historical data on Falcon 9 first stage landings. We will use algorithms such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Classification Trees, and Logistic Regression. Once the model is trained, we will evaluate its performance using separate test data to select the model that best predicts the success of the Falcon 9 first stage landing.
